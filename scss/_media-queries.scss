// Media Queries
//––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

// Note: The best way to structure the use of media queries is to create the queries
// near the relevant code. For example, if you wanted to change the styles for buttons
// on small devices, paste the mobile query code up in the buttons section and style it
// there.

// Larger than mobile
@media only screen and (min-width: $bp-larger-than-mobile) {}

// Larger than tablet
@media only screen and (min-width: $bp-larger-than-tablet) {}

// Larger than desktop
@media only screen and (min-width: $bp-larger-than-desktop) {}
